## SQL Project: Customer Sales Analysis

### Overview:
This project involved using MySQL Workbench to analyze extensive sales data from a supermarket, aiming to uncover insights into revenue generation, identify top-selling branches, and segment customers. I examined popular products and payment methods while analyzing sales trends to understand seasonal patterns and growth trajectories.

Additionally, this technical report presents a series of SQL queries crafted to analyze a dataset with detailed sales transaction information. By employing various SQL techniques, we explored the data to identify significant trends, patterns, and anomalies. The results provided valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall business performance.

10. **Average Gross Margin Percentage by Product Line:** Calculated the average gross margin percentage for each product line.
```
SELECT Product_line, AVG(gross_margin_percentage) AS avg_margin_percentage
FROM sales
GROUP BY Product_line;
```
11. **Day with Highest Sales Volume:** Determined the day of the week with the highest sales volume.
```
SELECT IFNULL(DAYNAME(Date), 'Unknown') AS day_of_week, COUNT(*) AS num_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY DAYNAME(Date), Date
ORDER BY num_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
12. **Total Quantity Sold by Product Line:** Calculated the total quantity sold for each product line.
```
SELECT Product_line, SUM(Quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY Product_line;
```
13. **Total Tax Amount Collected by Gender:** Calculated the total tax amount collected for each gender.
```
SELECT Gender, SUM(COALESCE(`Tax_5%`, 0)) AS total_tax_amount
FROM sales
GROUP BY Gender;
```

14. **Find the total revenue generated by each branch** Calculated the total revenue generated by each gender.
```
SELECT Branch, SUM(Total) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY Branch;
```

15. **Join the sales data with customer data to find the total revenue generated by each customer type:**
``` 
SELECT s.Customer_type, SUM(s.Total) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_data s
JOIN customers c ON s.Customer_type = c.Customer_type
GROUP BY s.Customer_type;
```

### Conclusion:
The analysis of the sales data reveals several key insights:

Sales Performance: The total sales amount to approximately $322,966.75, indicating a strong revenue performance. However, the average customer rating is 6.97, suggesting that there may be areas for improvement in customer satisfaction.

Branch Performance: The sales distribution shows varying performance across different branches, with some branches outperforming others. This could indicate the need for targeted marketing strategies or operational improvements in lower-performing branches.

Product Line Insights: Different product lines have distinct sales volumes, which can inform inventory management and promotional strategies. Understanding which product lines are more popular can help in optimizing stock levels and marketing efforts.

Customer Demographics: The analysis of customer demographics shows that both gender and customer type play a role in purchasing behavior. This information can be leveraged to tailor marketing campaigns and improve customer engagement.

Pricing and Quantity Relationships: The relationship between unit price and total sales, as well as quantity sold and total sales, indicates that pricing strategies and sales volume are crucial for maximizing revenue. Adjusting prices or promoting higher quantity purchases could enhance sales performance.

Overall, the data suggests that while the sales figures are strong, there is potential for growth through improved customer satisfaction, targeted marketing, and strategic pricing.
